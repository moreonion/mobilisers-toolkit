- **Foundation CSS**: Use existing `.button.filled`, `.button.small`, grid classes
- **Existing components**: Reuse Feedback component as-is
- **File organization**: Follow existing `/src/functions/`, `/src/types/` structure

## Statistical Implementation Notes

**✅ VALIDATED STATISTICAL APPROACH:**

- **Two-proportion tests**: Use `jStat.fn.twoSidedDifferenceOfProportions(p1, n1, p2, n2)` for p-values - purpose-built for A/B testing
- **Confidence intervals**: Use unpooled standard error: `√[p1(1-p1)/n1 + p2(1-p2)/n2]` (different from hypothesis testing)
- **Hypothesis testing vs CI**: Pooled SE for significance testing (assumes H0: p1=p2), unpooled SE for confidence intervals (estimates true difference)
- **Chi-square implementation**: Manual statistic calculation with `jStat.chisquare.cdf(statistic, df)` for p-values
- **jStat advantages over simple-statistics**: Built-in proportion difference tests, z-test functions (`jStat.ztest`, `jStat.zscore`), comprehensive distribution functions
- **Bonferroni correction**: Exact implementation from PRD (lines 170-182) for multiple testing scenarios
- **Statistical validation**: Verified against standard references (Wikipedia, Penn State statistics course)

| **Validation Status**: **Our implementation matches Evan Miller's gold-standard calculator within 0.0002** |
| **Methodology**: Two-proportion z-test with pooled standard error (standard statistical practice)          |
| **Edge Cases**: Handles zero conversions with continuity correction                                        |
